# Museum-Of-Candy
A mock-up website inspired by the instagrammable Museum of Candy in New York. 
The purpose of this website is to demonstrate some skills in bootstrap 4 and the grid system, including responsiveness and mobile-friendly content.

HTML, CSS, and a little bit of javascript are used in this project.
